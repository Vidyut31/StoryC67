once upon a time, there was a monkey who resided on a tree on the bank of the river. In the same river lived a Crocodile and his wife.One day a Crocodile came to know that. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The Crocodile came back next day for more fruits as he loved them. s days passed by the Crocodile and the monkey became good friednds. 
One day the monkey gave fruits for Crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits and was jealous as she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband " Idf the fruits are so juicy I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart will be?\?". CAn you get me the heart of the monkey.
The Crocodile was not willing to kill his friend but had no choice.
